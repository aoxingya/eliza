Project Name: TaskAI
1. Project Overview
TaskBot is a multifunctional smart assistant that combines rule-based conversation engines (similar to ELIZA) with API integration (inspired by Grub). It is designed to facilitate both natural language conversations and task execution, like fetching data or automating certain operations.

2. Key Features
Natural Language Dialogue: Simulates basic conversation using predefined response patterns.
Task Execution: Identifies and performs specific tasks based on user commands, such as using APIs or internal rules to handle requests.
Multiple Integrations: Connects to various common APIs (e.g., weather, news, database queries) and can interact with third-party services.
3. Project Structure
a) Core Module
Dialogue Engine: A rule-based system that recognizes keywords or patterns to respond to users.
NLP Module: Analyzes user commands to identify intent, distinguishing between conversation and task requests.
API Integration Module: Manages external data retrieval, such as weather or news, using third-party APIs.
b) Task Engine
Task Recognizer: Interprets the user’s intent to differentiate between basic conversation and specific tasks.
Task Executor: Works with the API module to perform tasks as requested.
Task Feedback: Returns results to the user in conversational format.
c) Database Module
Conversation History: Logs chat history for continued conversation or improving future interactions.
Task Records: Stores task history for easy future reference.
d) Configuration and Management Module
API Management: Manages credentials, URLs, and configurations for each API.
Dialogue Rule Management: Maintains and expands the response patterns for more dynamic conversations.
4. Implementation Details
a) Dialogue Engine
Uses basic rule-based matching similar to ELIZA’s, responding to user prompts based on keyword patterns.
b) NLP Module
Uses libraries like spaCy or Hugging Face Transformers to identify the intent behind user requests and map them to specific tasks.
c) API Integration Examples
Weather API: Responds to questions like “What’s the weather?” by calling a weather API.
News API: Returns current news headlines when prompted.
Database Query: Accesses historical records of tasks upon user request.
d) Task Recognition and Feedback
Once a task is recognized, TaskBot initiates the appropriate processing module and returns the results to the conversation.
5. Suggested Tech Stack
Backend: Python (Flask or FastAPI)
NLP: spaCy or Transformers
Database: SQLite or PostgreSQL
Frontend: A simple web interface (React or Vue)

6. Example Code
a) Dialogue Engine
python
复制代码
# core/dialog_engine.py
class DialogEngine:
    def __init__(self):
        self.rules = {
            "weather": ["weather", "temperature"],
            "news": ["news", "headlines"],
        }

    def get_response(self, user_input):
        for key, keywords in self.rules.items():
            if any(word in user_input for word in keywords):
                return f"This is a response about {key}."
        return "I'm sorry, I don't understand your question."
b) Task Processing
python
复制代码
# tasks/weather_task.py
import requests

class WeatherTask:
    def __init__(self, api_key):
        self.api_key = api_key

    def get_weather(self, location):
        url = f"https://api.weatherapi.com/v1/current.json?key={self.api_key}&q={location}"
        response = requests.get(url)
        if response.status_code == 200:
            data = response.json()
            return f"The weather in {location} is {data['current']['condition']['text']} with a temperature of {data['current']['temp_c']}°C."
        return "Unable to retrieve weather information."
This structure gives TaskBot the flexibility to expand into a powerful, multi-functional assistant that integrates conversation and task capabilities, creating a smart assistant ready for practical applications.
